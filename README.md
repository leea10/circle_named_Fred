# circle_named_Fred
My Code Poem (Project #3) for Art, Code, Interactivity class

**Run Instructions**

Run display.html in a browser that supports HTML5 canvas (e.g. Chrome)

**Description**

The output is a limerick and simple visual 

It's about an unfulfilled and rather fickle circle named Fred


-----------------------------------------

There once was a circle named Fred

He dreamed to be stroked with bright red

Yay CSS

His dream, a success

But now he wants yellow instead

-----------------------------------------


The function calls in the code also form a companion poem!

-----------------------------------------

Draw('a_circle');

Name_it('Fred');

Make_his_dream('to become red');



Do('some_magic');

Dreams_come(true);

Make_Fred_want('a_different_hue');

------------------------------------------

**Known Issues**

Right now, these function calls are completely trivial.

I was hoping to (and might one day accomplish) divide the output-generating code into the function declarations
so these function calls are no longer trivial and the code becomes more modular!
